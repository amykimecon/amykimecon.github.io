[**The Effects of Prohibiting Marriage Bars: The Case of U.S. Teachers**](https://amykimecon.github.io/files/marriagebars.pdf)---with Carolyn Tsao (Revise and Resubmit, _Journal of Economic History_)

Winner of the 2024 [IPUMS USA Research Award](https://www.ipums.org/impact/ipums-research-award)

Married women in the early 20th century U.S. faced “marriage bars,” a form of employer discrimination that barred them from paid employment. However, because the end of marriage bar use coincided with shifting social norms and labor market conditions, it is unclear how the end of marriage bars affected women’s employment. We study the effects of the legislative prohibition of marriage bars in teaching during the 1930s. A difference-in-differences design shows that the prohibitions increased the share of married women teachers, partly by pushing unmarried women out of the labor force, and modestly increased women’s labor force participation.


**Who Pays the Cost of Exclusion?: Selection into Immigration Under the 1885 Chinese Head Tax**

While the cost of immigration to the U.S. and Canada can add up to many thousands of dollars, variation in these costs (when measurable at all) often stem from underlying changes in immigration policy, making it difficult to measure the effects of high migration cost on both the size and the composition of the immigrant pool. Using an 1885 immigration policy, known as the Chinese Head Tax, which charged a exogenously varying flat fee to Chinese immigrants to Canada, and extensive microdata on Chinese immigrants at the time of their arrival to Canada, I estimate that the Head Tax (which at its peak was equivalent to three years' salary for the average Chinese immigrant) reduced immigration from China by 34\%. I also find that as the cost of migration increased, Chinese immigrants to Canada became more positively selected on the basis of height, occupation, literacy, and home ownership, suggesting that the poorest prospective immigrants (and likely those with the most to gain from immigration) were effectively ‘priced out’ by the policy.
