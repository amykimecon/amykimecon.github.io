**Who Pays the Cost of Exclusion?: Selection into Immigration Under the 1885 Chinese Head Tax**

While the cost of immigration to the U.S. and Canada can add up to many thousands of dollars, variation in these costs (when measurable at all) often stem from underlying changes in immigration policy, making it difficult to measure the effects of high migration cost on both the size and the composition of the immigrant pool. Using an 1885 immigration policy, known as the Chinese Head Tax, which charged a exogenously varying flat fee to Chinese immigrants to Canada, and extensive microdata on Chinese immigrants at the time of their arrival to Canada, I estimate that the Head Tax (which at its peak was equivalent to three years' salary for the average Chinese immigrant) reduced immigration from China by 34\%. I also find that as the cost of migration increased, Chinese immigrants to Canada became more positively selected on the basis of height, occupation, literacy, and home ownership, suggesting that the poorest prospective immigrants (and likely those with the most to gain from immigration) were effectively ‘priced out’ by the policy.
